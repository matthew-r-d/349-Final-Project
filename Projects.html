            <div class="text">In community college, I was lucky to participate in NCAS, NASA’s Community College Aerospace Scholars program.  To participate, I had to apply with my GPA, a recommendation from a superior, and an essay outlining why I should be awarded this opportunity.  I was accepted, and during the program, I was put in a team of 7 where we had to build a replica of a potential future Mars’ rover, and program it to complete an obstacle course.  My team won the competition between 3 other groups.  During this project, I learned how to work in a STEM work environment, network with NASA and Google employees, and learned about the Space and Aerospace industry.  I highly recommend participating in the project for community college students, more information can be found <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/nasa-community-college-aerospace-scholars/" target="_blank">here!</a></div>

            <div class="text">Although not traditionally seen as a project, a person’s work no doubt allows them to learn new skills, practice pre existing stills, gain experience, and network.  As such, I have put my work as a barista at Erewhon as a project of mine.  Here, I have learned a number of different skills, including staying calm in a high-demand, fast-place environment, and working in a very diverse environment.  Adding, I have networked with both higher management and customers who work in the industry I wish to have a career in.  Erewhon has given me the opportunity to expand my skill set, and network with potential industry hirers.

            <div class="text">A side, and unique, project of mine was running the Sony Pictures Tour Department’s official instagram page.  I was lucky enough to have a part time internship with the tour department over the summer of 2024!  During my internship, I was in charge of the official instagram page.  This was my first time working in the media field and I learned how to engage with the public through social media, promoting Sony’s upcoming movies and tours of the movie studio.  All Instagram posts from June 6th to April 6th 2024 were created by me, all of which you can find here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonypicturestours/?hl=en" target="_blank">@sonypicturestours</a></div>
