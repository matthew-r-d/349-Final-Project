This is my personal portfolio website.
To run my project from scratch, please do the following:
Clone the repsority with the code below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthew-r-d/349-Final-Project.git
```
Then open Visual Studio Code and go to >File > Open Folder, and click on the folder "349-Final-Project" that was cloned from the repository

Then simply run any .html file to get started.  I highley recommend starting with the homePage.html file.

***

You can navigate through the website using the horizontal menu bar found at the top of every webpage.

The contact form on the "Contact" page sends user input to the console using js, since I did not use a backend email service.

I also used js for the slide show found at the bottom of the "Projects" page.
