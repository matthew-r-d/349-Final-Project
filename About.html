            <div class="text">A little about my background, I was born and raised in LA county. Both of my parents as well. However, my grandparents are originally from Arizona and Texas. I have one older sister, who I am very close to. Additionally, I have a boyfriend and we have been together for 2 years. I originally majored in communications, but switched to computer science after taking a coding class. I switched back to majoring in communications because I found that I only like to code and am not interested too much in other aspects of computer science. However, I decided to minor in it, as I enjoy coding and have a strong foundation in the subject.</div>

            <div class="text">I graduated from a public high school with a 3.4 GPA. I began my undergraduate career at a community college before transferring to CSUF. Currently, I have a 3.3 GPA and have made the Deanâ€™s List three times in my college career. In community college, I took part in NCAS (NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars). In this program, I worked in a team of 5 building a model rover and programming it to complete an obstacle course, simulating a Martian Rover. In addition to my team winning the competition, I learned how to operate and work well in a team setting.</div>

            <div class="text">I have a number of interests. The biggest passion that I have is traveling. I have traveled to a number of different places. Within the United States, I have traveled to Arizona, Nevada, all of the East Coast states, and Hawaii. Internationally, I have been to Mexico, Costa Rica, South Korea, China, and Ireland. Currently, I am planning a trip to Austria and France in January 2025. I think my interest in traveling is sparked by my passion for anthropology. I love learning about different cultures, learning new languages, and seeing how other people live.</div>
