            <div class="text">The first coding language that I learned in undergrad was C++.  Although I have also learned Java and SQL, I have always preferred C++ due to its syntax and wide variety of usage.  My experience with the language has helped me develop a strong understanding of object-oriented programming and algorithms.  This skill in C++ has made it easier for me to learn other languages and has provided me with a strong foundation to learn other skills within computer science.</div>

            <div class="text">As mentioned on the Home Page, I am majoring in communication studies.  Although many think that everybody knows how to communicate, through my studies, I have learned how to communicate effectively.  I have found that this skill has been instrumental in both my private and professional life.  I work as a barista in a fast paced location that sees many different customers, many of which are tourists.  I have quickly worked my way up to a management position, and it is my communication skills that have allowed me to do this.  Being able to communicate between the needs of the customer and the needs of my coworkers is an essential tool that is necessary in any field or career path.
